You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a countertop 1, a garbagecan 1, a handtowelholder 2, a handtowelholder 1, a sinkbasin 2, a sinkbasin 1, a toilet 1, a toiletpaperhanger 1, and a towelholder 1.
Your task is to: clean some cloth and put it in cabinet.
Act 1: think: To solve the task, I need to find and take a cloth, then clean it with sinkbasin, then put it in a cabinet.
Obs 1: OK.
Act 2: think: First I need to find a cloth. A cloth is more likely to appear in a handtowelholder (1-2), a sinkbasin (1-2), a towelholder (1). I can check one by one, starting with a handtowelholder 1.
Obs 2: OK.

Obs 5: Nothing happens.
Act 6: take handtowel 1 from handtowelholder 1

Obs 9: Nothing happens.
Act 10: clean handtowel 1 with sinkbasin 1

Act 30: go to sinkbasin 1
Obs 30: On the sinkbasin 1, you see nothing.
